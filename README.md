## Info

This is a theme carefully crafted & designed for modern computer screens, inspired by [Microsoft Fluent Design System](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/).

## ⚠ Alert

To speed up rendering, it is suggested to **download all the fonts and install them on your system**. (Hence no font was included in the theme package. If the theme was used in your system without the fonts below installed, your document would be rendered with the default fonts.)

Fontfaces you should install before fully utilizing this theme:

- [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/download/v3.15/Inter-3.15.zip), provided in github repo.
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://download.jetbrains.com/fonts/JetBrainsMono-1.0.3.zip), provided in github repo.
- [思源黑体 CN](https://www.onlinedown.net/download/1122151?module=download) (**Only if you need support for Chinese.**)
- 思源宋体 CN (**Optional. Only if you need support for Chinese.**)


The translucent effect might not work on Linux.


## Languages Supported

English, 简体中文



## Tricky Escapings

Some escapings were implemented in css:


- Bold text in h5 (example: `##### **12** What does fluent mean?`) would be rendered like this:

  It might be useful in your homework. 😆

- h4, h5, h6 in blockquotes would be rendered with an icon before the text:

  Ensure that you have **Font Awesome** files included in your typora theme directory (`./themes/fluent`). Files are provided in directory `fluent`.
